          <p>Hi and welcome to whatever this is.</p>
          <p>My name is Baird. I'm a climate scientist working in energy transition research at <a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/">Global Energy Monitor</a>, where I manage <a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-oil-infrastructure-tracker/"oil>oil</a> and <a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-gas-infrastructure-tracker/">gas</a> infrastructure databases. I'm interested in maps and design, and weather and climate, and I've been teaching myself how to make things online lately. I believe very strongly in open-source and creative commons stuff.</p>
          <p>I studied geophysics in college and then did graduate work in atmospheric and oceanic science. After about a decade in academia, I shifted to work as an academic editor at <a href="https://www.nature.com/nclimate/">Nature Climate Change</a>, where I was before I began my current role.</p>
          <p>I've spent a lot of my career using Python and matplotlib to wrangle and visualize data. In my free time, I'm attempting to improve my data visualization and mapping skills, and maybe give a go at some low-stakes data journalism projects. Check back later for more.</p>
          <p><strong>contact me</strong></p>
          <p>My email address is my first and last name smushed together, no caps or punctuation, at gmail.</p>
          <p>I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsbaird">@heyitsbaird</a> on X.</p>
