        <p>Hi, and welcome to whatever this is. : )</p>
        <p>My name is Baird. I'm a climate scientist working in energy transition research at <a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/">Global Energy Monitor</a>, where I manage <a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-oil-infrastructure-tracker/"oil>oil</a> and <a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-gas-infrastructure-tracker/">gas</a> infrastructure databases. I'm interested in maps and web design, and I've been teaching myself how to make things online lately.</p>
        <p>I work from home in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
        <p>I studied geophysics in college and then did graduate work in atmospheric and oceanic science. After about a decade in academia, I shifted to work as an academic editor at <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/nclimate/">Nature Climate Change</a></em>, and I went on to energy research after that.</p>
        <p>I've spent a lot of my career using Python and matplotlib to wrangle and visualize data. I'm trying to use 2024 to improve my online data visualization and mapping know-how, and maybe give a go at some low-stakes data journalism projects. We'll see how it goes.</p>
