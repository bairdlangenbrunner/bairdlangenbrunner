using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3RFk35synM

ssh root@46.202.89.200

install nginx
(I don't think apache2 was already running, skipped those steps)

apt clean all
apt update
apt dist-upgrade

apt install nginx


now go to IP address:
46.202.89.200

looks like nginx is running!

cd /var/www/html
it has this html file:
index.nginx-debian.html


now cd to home

apt install nodejs
apt install npm
apt install git

cd /home

mkdir sites
(ubuntu folder is already there)

git clone https://github.com/bairdlangenbrunner/bairdlangenbrunner.git

cd bairdlangenbrunner
npm install

there were some security risks, I ran: npm audit fix
13 packages got changed... 


npm run build
cp -r dist/* /var/www/html/




AND TO MAKE NGINX POINT BACK TO INDEX:
go to:
/etc/nginx/sites-available

vi bairdlangenbrunner

paste this inside:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 46.202.89.200;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }
}

and symbolically link them to enable it?

ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bairdlangenbrunner /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

nginx restart


AND THAT WORKED!!!
nginx -t --> tells you if config files are working
nginx -T --> gives even more info...

systemctl status nginx

rename bairdlangenbrunner to bairdlangenbrunner.conf
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bairdlangenbrunner.conf .

change to:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 46.202.89.200;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}


I didn't delete the default file...


put site in /var/www/
(bairdlangenbrunner)

npm install -g pm2  (-g installs it globally, look at npm root -g for more)
